                    <h3><b>Impact on Soldiers</b></h3>
					<p>Stresses of the war were obviously high. Soldiers faced death, starvation, disease, boredom, and loneliness. 
					American soldiers faced mental breakdowns, shellshock, and PTSD after returning home from war. During this time 
					period, there was a stigma against mental health issues so many did not seek help. Men were deemed cowardly or weak
					if they admitted to mental health issues. Seeking treatment for such issues was also expensive. Soldiers suffered internally.
					After the war, suicide rates increased. Suicide ended the pain and injuries that could not be seen on the outside. Historians
					even speculate that soldiers willingly walked into the line of enemy fire to end their lives. </p>
					<p>Sadly, this is similar to today. Soldiers returning from war zones often suffer from PTSD and many do not seek help. Though mental
					health is not as stigmatized as it was during the 1900s, soldiers often feel weak for admitting to psychological issues. There are VA
					centers nowadays that offer free treatment and screenings to soldiers returning from war zones, thankfully, to help them integrate into
					civilian life more easily.</p>

                    <h3><b>Impact on Families</b></h3>
					<p> 
					The war forced women to join the workforce. When soldiers were drafted and left for Europe, jobs in America needed to be filled to support 
					the war effort and the economy. Older children had to take help manage the household and care for the younger siblings. When men returned from
					the war, they did not return the same. Many were suffering from physical disabilities (loss of limbs, blindness, deafness, etc.) effects of poison 
					gas, and had psychological problems. Men woke up to nightmares of death and war after returning. This put much tension on life at home. Fathers and
					sons closed up.  Children and wives did not fully understand the agony the war and the effects of the trauma. Communication within the family unit 
					was difficult and many families fell apart. In addition, some men could not return to work because of their injuries. With inflation, the cost of
					life was high. Women had to work, care for the children, and care for their husbands. Life in America had truly transformed because of the war. </p>

                    <h3><b>Impact on American Economy</b></h3>
					<p>The war caused a technology boost in America. During the war, many new weapons were developed and America decided it was not going to stop 
					their. The production of automobiles, airplanes, radios, and chemicals skyrocketed after the war. Mass production helped the economy, however,
					the war had caused inflation in America. Even with higher wages, citizens were not able to always purchase luxury items. US manufacturers had 
					built up large inventories of products, but the public could not consume them. Europe no longer relied on materials to support their countries 
					and armies so American exports also decreased. America soon went into a recession. This caused high unemployment rates, business bankruptcies,
					and falling wages. America would returned to economic prosperity around 1922, however, soon the Great Crash of 1929 would hit. World War II 
					would help bring the America out of the Great Depression. </p>
