                        <p>Vickers guns were machine guns produced by the British. They required a six-man team to operate
						but were reliable. Machine guns made an already bloody war, much more bloodier. Another machine gun
						used in war is America’s Lewis gun (lighter than Vickers).</p>
						<h4>Impact Today:</h4>
						<p>
						Machine guns are used by militaries all over the world and are the most common weapon. 
						Machine guns are lighter, faster to operate, and more portable. They are carried
						by infantry or even mounted on ships and planes.

                        <p>British Mark I was the first tank. It was designed in 1915 and saw combat in September 1916. 
						The French soon followed with its own tank. Tanks protected their occupants from small arms 
						fire to allow soldiers to get across “no man’s land” without getting killed. </p>
						<h4>Impact Today:</h4>
						<p>
						Today’s tanks have better armor, increased firepower, and move much faster. However,
						the basics of the tanks established during the war remain constant. The US and Britain
						militaries use tanks mainly in the Middle East.

                        <p>The first design for the modern flamethrower was submitted to the German army in 1901. 
						However, the flamethrowers true potential was realized during the war. Flamethrowers could
						burn alive soldiers in confined spaces without inflicting structural damage to the bunkers. </p>
						<h4>Impact Today:</h4>
						<p>
						During the World War II, flamethrowers were mounted on tanks. Nowadays,
						flamethrowers are not heavily used in war zones. They are still used domestically
						to create controlled burns by land-management departments.

                        <p>Germany was the first to use chemical weapons as means for a large scale attack on its 
						enemies during the war. Soon after, both sides used chemical warfare causing lung and 
						respiratory problems and blindness in one million and killing 70000 total. </p>
						<h4>Impact Today:</h4>
						<p>
						Chemical weapons were not used heavily during the second World War. During the Cold War,
						the United States and Soviet Union developed stockpiles of chemical weapons. In August 2013,
						Syrian forces were accused of using chemical weapons against its own citizens.

                        <p>Soldiers fought during all hours. This is why British invention of tracer bullets became 
						extremely useful during the war. Tracer bullets emitted a bright green-white trail allowing 
						soldiers to see where they were shooting during night combat. Tracer bullets could also ignite
						hydrogen gas bags of German Zeppelins to bring down the airships.</p>
						<h4>Impact Today:</h4>
						<p>
						Tracer bullets are still used in combat. During World War II, the United States’ naval 
						and marine aircrew used tracer bullets in their side arms. The bullets were used for emergency signaling.

                        <p>During the war, aircrafts were used for reconnaissance of enemy positions. 
						The Royal Naval Air Service converted ships to have large, flats landings decks 
						to land planes. In 1917, British Squadron Commander Edwin Harris Dunning managed
						to land his fighter plane on a short runaway built onto a battle cruiser.</p>
						<h4>Impact Today:</h4>
						<p>
						Aircraft carriers are a cornerstone of naval power. The United States has the largest 
						collection of carriers in the world. It officially operates a fleet of 11.
						About 80 aircrafts belong to each of the 11 carriers in the fleet.
