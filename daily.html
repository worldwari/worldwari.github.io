                    <h3><b>Life in Trenches</b></h3>
					<p>The western front trenches ran in a four-hundred-mile line from the North Sea to the Alps. Trenches had several lines: 
					the main line and four behind it. They were about four feet wide and eight feet deep. The sides were reinforced with sandbags,
					bundles of sticks and logs, or sheet metal. Trenches were dug in zigzag patterns. The zigzags would keep sheet fragments from 
					spreading far. Machine guns were placed along the lines where there were strong points built of concrete.  </p>
					<p>In the trenches, there were rats and rotting flesh. Rats spread disease and fed on the bodies on dead soldiers. 
					The dead were buried in or near the trenches. Sergeant Jack Dorgan writes, “I found them lying just a few yards away. 
					They’d had their legs blown off and all I could see when I got to them was their thigh bones. I will always remember 
					their white thigh bones. The rest of their legs were gone.” His fellow soldiers lost their limbs to an artillery attack. 
					Limbs that were blown off during an attack could be found lying in the trenches. </p>
					<p>However, many in the trenches rarely saw the enemy. They spent their days simply surviving. They had to repair damage
					from artillery shells or cave-ins, haul food and water to the front lines, and carry wounded soldiers to the rear lines.
					Every two weeks, new units came up to the front lines to relieve those who served on the line. The relieved unit had about
					a week of “rest” in the rear lines.  </p>

                    <h3><b>Trauma and Affection</b></h3>
					<p>World War One was the war when war neurosis or “shellshock” was officially recognized. Symptoms include nightmares, 
					blindness, loss of smell and taste, temporary amnesia, and paralysis. In 1916, mental wards were located on base hospitals.
					65 percent of soldiers who were affected by shellshock during war were “treated” and sent back to the frontlines. Nearly 80,000 
					cases of shellshock were reported in postwar England. </p>
					<p>Soldiers looked after each other. Prewar men showing affection or care was seen as “unmanly”. However, during times of war, 
					fellow soldiers rallied around their fallen men. They took care of each other when sick or wounded; they wrapped blankets around 
					each other and spooned during the cold of the night. For example, Lance Corporal DH Fenton wrote to Jim Noone’s (fallen soldier)
					mother, “I held him in my arms to the end, and when his soul departed I kissed him twice where I knew you would have kissed him 
					– on the brow – once for his mother and once for myself". </p>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h3><b>Sex and the War </b></h3>
					<p>Prior the war, sex was a taboo subject. Sex was for reproduction. People did not openly discuss their sex lives nor have sex simply 
					for pleasure (with exceptions, of course).  The war changed this. Soldiers lived in trenches and faced death daily; they sought sex 
					release whenever possible. Corporal George Ashurst of the 1st Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers talked about his visit to a French brothel
					for World War I soldiers. He said, “We were drinking vin blanc...and it was absolutely crowded. There were five women in there...The stairs 
					leading up to bedrooms were full; there was a man on every step, waiting his turn to go in with a woman”. Soldiers could be punished if caught
					by a superior officer partaking in sexual activities. </p>
					<p>During this time period, partaking in homosexual acts were illegal. Corporal Tommy Keele of the 11th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, 
					recalled a time when he shared a bed with bandmaster. He said: 'On about the third night, I woke up with a funny little movement round 
					my bottom. I thought, "Oh, he's having a dream", so I sort of brushed his hand away and dropped off again. A little later the same thing
					again; I felt a hand around my bottom again and I pushed the hand away quickly and said: "Don't you dare!" However, during the war, soldiers
					were sex-starved. Many soldiers were young and still virgins who did not want to die as virgins. Brothels, prostitutes, discreet homosexual 
					activities, and STDs were quite common during the war.  </p>
